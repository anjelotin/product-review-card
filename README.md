## What I learned

During this project I focused on:

- **Responsive Layouts:** I used mobile first approach and applied media queries with `rem` units for scalable design. I also learned the `<picture>` element can be used to switch image sources based on screen size.
- **Flexbox for Layout:** I applied Flexbox to stack the content on mobile and switch to two colum layout on larger screens.
- **Hover Effects:** I applied smooth transitions to the "Add to Cart" button using `transition` property.
- **CSS Organization:** I used custom properties from colors and fonts.

## Continued Improvements
A few things I would like to continue working on are:

- Making font sizes more fluid with the `clamp()` function.
- Try using CSS Grid and compare to Flexbox
